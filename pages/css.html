        <a href="../index.html">Back to HTML Notes</a>

        <p>The most basic CSS syntax is made up of a selector and a semicolon-separated list of declarations, with each of those declarations being made up of a property-value pair. E.g:</p>
        <p><b>div.bold-text {
            <p>font-weight: 700;</p>
        }
        </b></p>

        <!-- Selectors -->
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        <p>Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which the CSS rules apply. They are what is being "selected" for each rule.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Universal Selector (*)</b>: will select elements of any type. Represented by an asterisk. E.g:
            <p>* {
                <p>color: purple;</p>
            }
            </p>
            <p>Every element would have the colour purple applied to it.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Type Selector (element type)</b>: will select all elements of a given type. Represented by an stating the element. E.g:
                <p>div {
                    <p>color: white;</p>
                }
                </p>
                <p>Will change all &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; elements to white but ignore other elements </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Class Selector (.class_name)</b>: will select all elements of a given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Represented by a period followed by the name of the class attribute. E.g:
                <p>&lt;div class="alert_text"&gt;Emergency!&lt;/div&gt;</p>
                <p>.alert_text {
                    <p>color: red;</p>
                }
                </p>
                <p>Will change all elements with the &lt;div&gt; class="alert_text"&lt;/div&gt; class attribute</p>
                <p>Note: you can use the same class on as many elements as you want and HTML elements can have multiple class elements.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><b>ID Selector (#id_name)</b>: will select all elements of a given ID, which is an attribute you place on an HTML element, similar to a Class. The major difference is that an element can only have <b>one</b> ID. Represented by a hashtag followed by the name of the ID attribute. E.g:
                <p>&lt;div id="title"&gt;My Website&lt;/div&gt;</p>
                <p>.title {
                    <p>background_color: red;</p>
                }
                </p>
                <p>Will change all elements with the &lt;div&gt; id="title"&lt;/div&gt; ID attribute</p>
                <p>Note: IDs are only usually used when taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page. You should use IDs sparingly (if at all) and opt for classes instead. </p>
            </li>
            

        </ul>
